  abstract     = "This paper introduces OC1, a new algorithm for generating multivariate decision trees. Multivariate trees classify examples by testing linear combinations of the features at each non-leaf node of the tree. Each test is equivalent to a hyperplane at an oblique orientation to the axes. Because of the computational intractability of finding an optimal orientation for these hyperplanes, heuristic methods must be used to produce good trees. This paper explores a new method that combines deterministic and randomized procedures to search for a good tree. Experiments on several different real-world data sets demonstrate that the method consistently finds much smaller trees than comparable methods using univariate tests. In addition, the accuracy of the trees found with our method matches or exceeds the best results of other machine learning methods."

abstract = {The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning. New to the second edition are chapters on kernel machines, graphical models, and Bayesian estimation; expanded coverage of statistical tests in a chapter on design and analysis of machine learning experiments; case studies available on the Web (with downloadable results for instructors); and many additional exercises. All chapters have been revised and updated. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods. Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series}

abstract = {Through a series of recent breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This practical book shows you how. By using concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python frameworks-Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow-author Aurelien Geron helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You'll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With exercises in each chapter to help you apply what you've learned, all you need is programming experience to get started. Explore the machine learning landscape, particularly neural nets Use Scikit-Learn to track an example machine-learning project end-to-end Explore several training models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods Use the TensorFlow library to build and train neural nets Dive into neural net architectures, including convolutional nets, recurrent nets, and deep reinforcement learning Learn techniques for training and scaling deep neural nets}
